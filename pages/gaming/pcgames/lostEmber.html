<h2>review</h2>
<p>This game at first glance quite beautiful.
    The character is Wolf, yeah not human being.
    and wolf can run in the wild, envoke memories.
    wolf can control other animals.
</p>
<p>There is a bug i experienced</p>
<p>in some areas, no sound, quite weird</p>
<p>I do not want to play more, just watch movies from youtube, the female voiceover</p>
<p>I won't play twice, as it is not a big game</p>
<p>just watch it as movie</p>
