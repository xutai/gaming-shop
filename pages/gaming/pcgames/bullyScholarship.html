    <li>use <a href="https://bully.fandom.com/wiki/">bully.fandom.com</a> to get walkthough</li>
    <li>good news, in the late game, i found Cheat Engine could change game speed, use "speedhack", x4 speed is good enough,
        i could run faster but time elapsed faster too!
    </li>
    <li>sometines using trainer will make the game crash, i have done it many times. So I always tried to save the game in advance</li>
    <li>I had to save game as soon as i finished one mission, because i was afraid that the game would crash</li>
    <li>there is only few locations to save game, that's a pain in ass, when the game crashes, i have to start over</li>
    <li>I had to use skateboard or bike to run faster, that's a pain too,
        bacause sometimes i had to rob someone to get bike
    </li>
    <li>some times using trainer will fail some missions, for example using 
        "one hit kill" may reduce all people's health, in chapter 5 "finding Johnny Vincent" I got this "johnny was knocked out",
         the mission failed, I had to start over
    </li>
    <li>I found i spent a lot of time in running, walking, moving from point A to point B,
        always on the way
    </li>
    <li>
        there were glitches, for example, In chapter 5, using fire extinguisher to put out the fire,
        for few times i got this message "you hurted someone"
    </li>
    <li>this game is quite old, like "grand theft auto vice city</li>
    <li>i completed the game, and uploaded video tutorials to bilibili</li>
