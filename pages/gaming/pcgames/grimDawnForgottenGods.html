    <p>easy cheat engine</p>
    <p>bandicam HEVC not supported, whyï¼Ÿ
        and very laggy when the video is recoreded, even it's not laggy in the game
        . better try 1080p with window borderless, and h264 cpu 30 fps</p>
        <p>9 character class can be chosen, not bad!</p>
    <p>i think this game is too old, and endless tasks, quests.</p>
    <p>if i want to complete the game, it would cost me much time!!!</p>
